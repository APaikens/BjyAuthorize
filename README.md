BjyAuthorize
============

Goal
----
This module is designed provide a facade for Zend\Acl that will ease
its usage with modules and applications. By default, it provides simple
setup via config files or by using Zend\Db. This module also comes with
out-of-the-box support for and integration with ZfcUser.

Todo
----
 - Ability to change error template (might already be possible)
 - Ability to change table names for RDBMS-based providers

Usage and Configuration
-----------------------
Here is an annotated sample configuration file:

```php
<?php

return array(
    'bjyauthorize' => array(

        // set the 'guest' role as default (must be defined in a role provider)
        'default_role' => 'guest',

        /* this module uses a meta-role that inherits from any roles that should
         * be applied to the active user. the identity provider tells us which
         * roles the "identity role" should inherit from.
         *
         * for ZfcUser, this will be your default identity provider
         */
        'identity_provider' => 'BjyAuthorize\Provider\Identity\ZfcUserZendDb',

        /* role providers simply provide a list of roles that should be inserted
         * into the Zend\Acl instance. the module comes with two providers, one
         * to specify roles in a config file and one to load roles using a
         * Zend\Db adapter.
         */
        'role_providers' => array(
            
            /* here, 'guest' and 'user are defined as top-level roles, with 
             * 'admin' inheriting from user
             */

                )),
            ),

            // this will load roles from the user_role table in a database
            // format: user_role(role_id(varchar), parent(varchar))
            'BjyAuthorize\Provider\Role\ZendDb' => array()
        ),

        // resource providers provide a list of resources that will be tracked
        // in the ACL. like roles, they can be hierarchical
        'resource_providers' => array(
            'BjyAuthorize\Provider\Resource\Config' => array(
                'pants' => array(),
            ),
        ),

        /* rules can be specified here with the format:
         * array(roles (array), resource, [privilege (array|string), assertion])
         * assertions will be loaded using the service manager and must implement
         * Zend\Acl\Assertion\AssertionInterface.
         * *if you use assertions, define them using the service manager!*
         */
        'rule_providers' => array(
            'BjyAuthorize\Provider\Rule\Config' => array(
                'allow' => array(
                    // allow guests and users (and admins, through inheritance) 
                    // the "wear" privilege on the resource "pants"
                    array(array('guest', 'user'), 'pants', 'wear')
                ),

                // Don't mix allow/deny rules if you are using role inheritance.
                // There are some weird bugs.
                'deny' => array(
                    // ...
                ),
            ),
        ),

        /* Currently, only controller guards currently exist, though I may expand
         * to routes or something in the future
         */
        'guards' => array(
            /* If this guard is specified here (i.e. it is enabled), it will block
             * access to all controllers and actions unless they are specified here.
             * You may omit the 'action' index to allow access to the entire controller
             */
            'BjyAuthorize\Guard\Controller' => array(
                array('controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'index', 'roles' => array('guest','user')),
                array('controller' => 'index', 'action' => 'stuff', 'roles' => array('user')),
                array('controller' => 'zfcuser', 'roles' => array())
            ),
